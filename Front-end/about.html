	<p id='Sprook'> ++MOBA is a term for a variety of online multiplayer game. The communities are gernerally considered to be quite toxic,<br />
		As such, having an external platform to act as a gatekeeper operation of sorts would probably serve at least some of them well.++</p>
		<h3>Architecture</h3>
		<h2>"Hardware"</h2>
		<p>Most of the work was completed on windows machines. Mean is pretty good at
			cross platform compatability when compared with some other frameworks/languages.
			The start commands are different due to environment varaibles being used but
			that is about the only difference. This issue only became slightly problamatic when
			uploaded to our server setup heroku as it is unix based and automatically attempted
			to run the server. There were also a few hiccups with heroku needing to control
			additional information such as port numbers.

		<h2>Packages</h2>
		<p>
		On top of the regular Mean stack, our biggest use package was passport.js. Having heard
		a lot of good things about this package from industry developers on the podcast Shoptalkshow,
		it was suggested and works pretty well. It handles a lot of the session information
		for us aswell as keeping tracks of user data. It can also be expanded easily to
		allow login through things such as facebook or github. In our usecase a steamid link
		would probably be the next logical step in our user database.</p>

		<p>
			Although we all hope that our university projects are completely secure and
			potential users would be smart about the information they leave on our servers,
			it is important and ethical that we, as software engineers, keep the privacy
			or our users as the number one priority. We used BCRYPT to salt and hash our passwords
			so that even if a hacker was to access our database, they would not be able to
			determine the passwords from that alone.
