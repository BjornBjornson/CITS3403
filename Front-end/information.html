	<h2>Matchmaking</h2>
	<p>Rather than a traditional dating matchmaking app, we decided to go down
		the route of matching gamers together. Although a lot of games do automatic
		matchmaking, players prefer to play with friends and/or people they know. They
		are less likely to be 'toxic' and more likely to have an enjoyable experience
		and return to the game.Our app functions almost as a pre-lobby lobby and so
	we aimed to provide similar funcitonality.</p>
		<p>Our initial target games were MOBA's due to their in-game systems that
			push players, no matter what skill level, to work as a team, each with a
			different role. Metting players outside of the game through our app could
			potentially provide them with the same connection as a dating app would.
		</p>
		<p> A big difference with our approach compared to a traditional approach is
			that we are matching up to five people at once where as most apps would be a
			one-to-one match. Our main conditions are play area and time available, latency
			is a huge deal in online video games and in a large country such as Australia,
			timezones also play a big part. We also aimed to have a kick feature in, something
			present in most multiplayer games lobby systems. Another matching criteria is age-range,
			we delibrately kept this broad to protect children and would keep this information private
			as so to try and avoid a situation like <a href = "http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-02-22/cyber-expert-warning-gaming-app-roblox-children/8292712">Roblox</a>.
